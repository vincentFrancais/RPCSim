# RPCSim
This is a multithreaded C++ Monte Carlo simulation for Resitive Plate Chamber detectors, using Heed and Magboltz through the Garfield++ framework. It is developped as PhD Thesis project.

It's still a work-in-progress and actively updated. Expect many bugs and odd behaviors. 

There is no proper documentation yet and the code is, right now, not properly commented.
Also Makefile is not _bullet-proof_ and has to be edited depending on your distribution, GCC version and Garfield++ installation.
